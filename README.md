# H2 3D Printable Parts for use with GUN4IR and OpenFire

## H2 Wii Camera Enclosure

This enclosure fits a camera from a salvaged Wiimote and eatnooM's brilliant little PCB board: https://github.com/eatnooM/pixart-sensor-adapter

### H3 Features:

Same dimensions as the DFRobot version but a bit shorter.
Designed to work with eatnooM's PCB.
Includes a jig to hold the camera piece in place while soldering (with arms to fix to "helping hands")
Also included a push-fit lens mount.
IR filter needs to be glued to the front but I've left a gap between the camera pinhole and the lens/lens mount, where the thickness of a WiiMote IR filter will fit snugly.
Parts all designed in a way that they can be printed without supports or 3D printing unfriendly angles.
Everything should snap in place.

### H3 Parts:

Barrel - This is the M18 Threaded barrel with a slide mount inside for the PCB
Bottom - The base of the enclosure with space to feed 4 x 28AWG wires. Should push-fit into the Barrel
CamHolder - This is where you insert the Wii camera and the PCB. Should push-fit into the other end of the Barrel
Jig - A temporary piece to place the CamHolder so you can solder the PCB.
LensHolder - Pushfit mount between the front of the enclosure and Wideagle or Fisheye lens. Includes a space to fit a piece of IR filter.
Nut - An M18 Hex nut to help fix the enclosure to your controller. Print 2 of these.

Tested with printing on Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro and Bambu A1 Mini using 0.4 Nozzle and 0.2 Layer Height.

NOTE: I AM NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDING THE ORIGINAL CAD FILES.
